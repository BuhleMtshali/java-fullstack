## 🚀 Day 06: Arrays & Lists — Student Grades 📋 + Tic-Tac-Toe Board 🎮

### Welcome to Day 6 of my 🔥 Full-Stack Java Developer Journey!

Today was all about learning how to store multiple values like a real developer — not one lonely variable at a time 😭.

- So I built two mini projects to lock in the skills:

    - ✅ A Student Grader using ArrayList<Double>

    - ✅ A Tic-Tac-Toe board printer using a 2D array char[][]

- This day was basically: “Java, hold my data.” 💪📦


## 🧠 Concepts Practiced Today

### 📋 Collections & Arrays

- ArrayList<Double> and why we use Double not double

- Adding values dynamically (arrays can’t grow, ArrayLists can 😮‍💨)

- Enhanced for-loops (for-each)

- 2D arrays (char[][]) for grid-based data

### 🔁 Logic & Flow

- Nested loops (while inside while, for inside for)

- Input handling using Scanner

- Output formatting for clean console display

- Printing structured data like a grid 🧩

## 📌 Project 1: StudentGrader 🎲📋

### 🎯 What It Does

- This console app lets the user:

    - Enter multiple student grades ✅

    - Store them in an ArrayList

    - Loop through and assign a letter grade

    - Rerun the program if they want 🐝

- Basically a mini grading assistant that doesn’t judge… unless the mark is low 😭📉

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Program asks for grades

2. User can keep adding grades (addMore = yes)

3. Program loops through all grades and prints:

    - the grade %

    - the letter symbol (A/B/C etc.)


## 🧠 What I Learned

- Why collections use wrapper classes (Double not double)

- How to store unlimited user input (without choosing array size first)

- How nested loops can control user input flow

- How to process a list using a for-each loop cleanly


## 🎮 Project 2: TicTacToe Board Printer ❌⭕️

### 🎯 What It Does

- This mini program prints a Tic-Tac-Toe board using a 2D array:

    - char[][] board

    - Nested loops to print rows and columns

    - Adds separators like | and ---+---+--- to look like a real board

- This is the foundation of building an actual Tic-Tac-Toe game later 😈🎮


## 🧠 What I Learned

- How a 2D array represents a grid

- How to loop through rows and columns using nested loops

- How to format output to look structured and readable

- Why conditions matter to avoid printing extra separators

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech Used

| Tool         | Purpose                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------ |
| ☕ Java       | Main language            |
| 🧺 ArrayList | Store grades dynamically |
| 🧩 2D Arrays | Represent game boards    |
| 🔁 Loops     | Process data repeatedly  |
| 🎤 Scanner   | Get user input           |


## 🔥 Day 6 Takeaway

```“Data structures are just containers… but picking the right container is the real skill.” 🧠📦```

- Today I learned how to:

    - store multiple values

    - loop through collections and grids

    - print clean outputs

    - and build foundations for bigger projects

- This is the kind of stuff that powers:

    - grade systems 🎓

    - analytics dashboards 📊

    - games 🎮

    - real backend logic ⚙️

- More data, more structure, more “Java you will respect me.” 😤☕
