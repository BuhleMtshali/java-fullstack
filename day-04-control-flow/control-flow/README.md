## 🚀 Day 04: Conditional Logic & Grade Evaluation 🎓

### Welcome to Day 4 of my 🔥 Full-Stack Java Developer Journey.

Today was all about conditional logic, decision-making, and turning raw numbers into meaningful results.

This day’s mini project focuses on if / else chains, percentage calculations, and user-driven program flow — the kind of logic used in real academic systems and business apps.

## 🧩 Mini Project: Grade Checker 🐝

### 📌 Overview

- The Grade Checker is a console-based Java program that:

    - Accepts a student’s marks

    - Calculates their percentage

    - Assigns a letter grade (A–F)

    - Displays a clean summary

    - Allows the user to rerun the program

- Simple idea. Strong logic. Solid fundamentals.

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- if / else if / else decision structures

- Arithmetic operators (/, *)

- Percentage calculations

- Character variables (char)

- while loops for rerun control

- Scanner input handling

- Clearing the Scanner buffer correctly

- Formatting meaningful console output

## ⚙️ How the Program Works

### 🔹 User Inputs

- 📖 Module name

- 🐝 Overall test mark

- ⛳️ Student’s obtained mark

### 🔹 Program Logic

1. Calculates the student’s percentage:

```
(studentMark / overallMark) * 100

```

2. Assigns a letter grade based on percentage:

| Percentage | Grade |
| ---------- | ----- |
| 90–100     | A     |
| 80–89      | B     |
| 70–79      | C     |
| 50–69      | D     |
| Below 50   | F     |

3. Displays a full summary

4. Asks the user if they want to calculate again

## 🖥️ Sample Output

```
==== 👾 Summary 🎲 ====
🎮 Module Name: Mathematics
🐝 Overall Module Mark: 100
🙋🏻‍♀️ Student Mark: 78
👯‍♀️ Student percentage: 78.0%
🥦 Student Letter Grade: C

```

## 🧠 Key Lessons Learned

- How to chain conditions without overlapping logic

- Why condition order matters (highest → lowest)

- Using char for symbolic results

- Converting numeric data into readable outcomes

- Building user-friendly console programs

- Handling repeated execution cleanly with loops

## 🔥 Day 4 Takeaway

“Logic is just storytelling — but for computers.”

- Today strengthened my ability to:

- Translate rules into conditions

- Think in ranges instead of single values

- Build programs that respond intelligently to user input

- This is the foundation for validation, scoring systems, and business rules in real applications.
