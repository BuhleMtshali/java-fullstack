## 🚀 Day 04: Conditional Logic & Grade Evaluation 🎓

### Welcome to Day 4 of my 🔥 Full-Stack Java Developer Journey.

Today was all about conditional logic, decision-making, and turning raw numbers into meaningful results.

This day’s mini project focuses on if / else chains, percentage calculations, and user-driven program flow — the kind of logic used in real academic systems and business apps.

## 🧩 Mini Project: Grade Checker 🐝

### 📌 Overview

- The Grade Checker is a console-based Java program that:

    - Accepts a student’s marks

    - Calculates their percentage

    - Assigns a letter grade (A–F)

    - Displays a clean summary

    - Allows the user to rerun the program

- Simple idea. Strong logic. Solid fundamentals.

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- if / else if / else decision structures

- Arithmetic operators (/, *)

Percentage calculations

Character variables (char)

while loops for rerun control

Scanner input handling

Clearing the Scanner buffer correctly

Formatting meaningful console output
