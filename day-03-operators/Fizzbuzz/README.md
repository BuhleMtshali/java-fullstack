## 🚀 Day 03: Operators, Decisions & Loops Unlocked 🔓

### Welcome to Day 3 of my 🔥 Full-Stack Java Developer Journey.

Today was all about thinking like the computer — making decisions, looping through logic, and letting operators do the heavy lifting.

This day focused on conditionals + operators + loops, brought to life through two practical mini projects that test real reasoning, not just syntax.


## 🧠 Concepts Covered Today

- Arithmetic Operators (+ - * / %)

- Comparison Operators (> < ==)

- Logical Operators (&&)

- if / else if / else decision flow

- switch statements

- while and for loops

- Input validation & rerun logic

- Scanner buffer handling (Java’s sneaky boss fight 😤)

## 🧩 Project 1: Operator Playground 🎮

### 📌 Overview

An interactive console app that lets users explore Java operators through a menu-driven experience.

Think of it as a gym for Java logic 🏋🏾‍♀️ — every option works a different mental muscle.


## ⚙️ Features

- Menu Options:

    1. 🧮 Arithmetic Operations

    2. 👾 Comparison Check

    3. 🧩 Logical Decision Test

    3. 🚫 Exit


## 🔍 What Each Mode Does

### 🧮 Arithmetic Operations

- Takes two numbers + an operator

- Performs calculations using:

    ``` +, -, *, / ```

- Includes division-by-zero protection 🚫

### 👾 Comparison Check

- Compares two numbers using:

>, <, ==

- Outputs human-readable results

### 🧩 Logical Decision Test

- Asks for user’s name and age

- Uses conditional logic to decide:

    - Too young for an ID 🪪

    - Old enough to own one 🎊


## 🧠 Key Lessons Learned

- How operators power decision-making

- Why nextInt() + nextLine() need buffer clearing

- When to use switch vs if/else

- How clean menu logic improves UX

- Why exit logic must actually exit 😌


## 🔁 Project 2: FizzBuzz Loop Game 🎲

### 📌 Overview

- A classic FizzBuzz challenge with a twist — user-defined limits, loop control, and rerun logic.

- Simple idea. Serious logic flex.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- User enters a maximum number (1–30)

- Program loops from 0 to that number

- Outputs based on conditions


| Condition          | Output           |
| ------------------ | ---------------- |
| Divisible by 3 & 5 | 🎊 FizzzBuzzz 🎮 |
| Divisible by 3     | 🐝 Fizzzz        |
| Divisible by 5     | 🎰 Buzz          |
| Otherwise          | ⛳️ Miss          |

- User can rerun the loop or exit cleanly


## 🧠 Key Lessons Learned

- Proper use of % (modulus operator)

- Why order of conditions matters (&& first!)

- Combining for + while loops

- Loop boundaries and validation

- Turning logic puzzles into real programs

### 🔥 Day 3 Takeaway

``` “Java isn’t hard — thinking clearly is the real skill.” ```

- Today leveled up my ability to:

    - Translate human rules into code

    - Control program flow

    - Spot logical edge cases early

- This is where coding starts to feel powerful, not just academic.
