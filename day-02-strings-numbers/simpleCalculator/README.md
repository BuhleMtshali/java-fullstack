## 🧮 Java Mini Projects – Day 2

### Welcome to my Day 2 Java practice projects 🎉

These mini programs focus on Java syntax, control flow, loops, user input, and working with dates using modern Java APIs

## 📌 Projects Included

### 1️⃣ Basic Calculator

A simple console-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations and allows the user to rerun the program based on input.

### 2️⃣ Age Calculator

A console application that calculates a user’s exact age (years, months, and days) using Java’s LocalDate and Period classes.

## 🧮 Basic Calculator

### ✨ Features

- Accepts two numbers from the user

- Supports:

    - Addition (+)

    - Subtraction (-)

    - Multiplication (*)

    - Division (/)

    - Prevents division by zero 🚫

- Uses a while loop to rerun the program based on user input (yes/no)

- Uses switch statements for clean operator handling

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Scanner for user input

- while loops

- switch-case

- Input buffer handling (nextLine())

- Basic error handling logic

## ▶️ How to Run

```
javac BasicCalculator.java

java BasicCalculator

```

## 🎂 Age Calculator

### ✨ Features

- Prompts user for name and birthdate

- Validates date input using try-catch

- Prevents future dates (no time travelers allowed 🛸)

- Calculates age in:

    - Years

    - Months

    - Days

- Allows repeated calculations using a loop


## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- LocalDate and Period (modern Java Date API)

- Exception handling

- Date validation

- Loop control with user input

- Clean console output formatting


## ▶️ How to Run

```
javac AgeCalculator.java
java AgeCalculator

```

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java

- java.util.Scanner

- java.time.LocalDate

- java.time.Period


## 🚀 What I Learned

- How to control program flow using while loops

- How to properly handle user input and buffer issues

- How to work with dates safely in Java

- Why validating input is non-negotiable

- How to write cleaner, more readable Java code


## 🌱 Next Improvements (Future Ideas)

- Input validation for non-numeric values

- Support for more calculator operations

- GUI version using JavaFX

- Unit tests with JUnit
